      A cousin of the croissant is the Italian cornetto (in the Center and
      South) or brioche (in the North). These variants are often considered to
      be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to
      be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or
      brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the cornetto vuoto (Italian:
      "empty cornetto") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which
      include crema pasticciera (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They
      often come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings. Cornetto with
      cappuccino at the bar is one of the most common breakfasts in
      Italy.[citation needed]
